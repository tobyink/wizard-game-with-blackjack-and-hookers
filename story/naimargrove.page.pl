	As you walk north along the forest path, you recall the events that brought
	you here: the reading of your grandmother's last will and testment,
	the jewellery box she left you, and what you found inside.
	
	Her own children hadn't shown the signs of developing magic, but she'd
	seen them in you. She told you in the note how she'd struggled for years,
	deciding whether to tell you about the powers she and her ancestors had
	wielded, the same powers she saw growing in you, or whether to let the
	family's legacy die.
	
	You were pretty sure it was just her age. Had she been losing her mind
	and making things up? But her letters seemed so... sharp... so consistent.
	They didn't seem like the ravings of a mad old lady. But why hadn't she
	mentioned any of this while she was still alive? She must have had her
	own reasons for waiting until she was on her deathbed to pen her secrets
	and entrust them to you.
	
	A voice calls out of the trees on your right, bringing you back from your
	memories. It sounds like it's calling your name. "@{[ player ]}..." You
	can distinctly hear it now.
	
	The note told you to follow this path, but it didn't say for how long.
	Until the end of the path? Maybe you were *supposed* to follow the voice.
