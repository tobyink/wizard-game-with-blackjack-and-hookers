	As you walk along the forest path, you recall the events that brought
	you here: the reading of your grandmother's last will and testment,
	the jewellery box she left you, and what you found inside.
	
	Her own children hadn't shown the signs of developing magic, but she'd
	seen them in you. She told you in the note how she'd struggled for years,
	deciding whether to tell you about the powers she and her ancestors had
	wielded, the same powers she saw growing in you, or whether to let the
	family's legacy die.
	
	It seemed like such an easy decision to you. Of course you'd want to know!
	She must have had her own reasons for waiting until she was on her
	deathbed to pen her secrets and entrust them to you.
	
	A voice calls out of the trees, bringing you back from your memories.
	It sounds like it's calling your name. "@{[ player ]}..." You can
	distinctly hear it now.
	
	The note told you to stick to this path, but it didn't say for how long.
	Until the end of the path? Perhaps you'd already come along the path as
	far as you were supposed to go, and the voice was telling you that.
